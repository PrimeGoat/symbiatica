# Symbiatica Technical Specification — SRAP Refinement v1.1

## 1. Purpose & Scope
Symbiatica delivers a universal remote-execution and UI-streaming substrate that allows heterogeneous compute nodes to behave as one cohesive interactive environment. This document unifies the foundational MGX specification with enterprise-grade extensions and introduces additional refinements aligned with SRAP methodology to ensure world-class clarity, operational rigor, and implementation readiness. The scope covers architecture, behaviors, protocols, security, governance, observability, deployment, and lifecycle expectations for both baseline and premium deployments.

## 2. Strategic Objectives
1. **Transparent Remote Execution:** Remote binaries execute exclusively on remote Symbiot Nodes while appearing local through filesystem grafting and execution interception.
2. **Pocket-Grade UX Fidelity:** Remote GUI/audio surfaces are rendered as native windows with imperceptible latency, including composition and semantic streaming modes.
3. **Holistic Situation Handling:** Automatic propagation and resolution of dialogs, spawned processes, and contextual events through ACL-driven policies and user prompts.
4. **Enterprise Hardening:** Built-in support for security, compliance, resilience, observability, and integration expectations of regulated and mission-critical environments.
5. **Scalable Nervous System:** Symbiot Broker fabric orchestrates node pools, high availability, auto-scaling, and session mobility with zero-downtime upgrades.

## 3. Conceptual Architecture
| Layer | Role | Analogy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Symbiot Nodes | Execute workloads, provide capture/streaming, enforce sandboxing | Organs |
| Symbiot Broker Fabric | Directory, scheduler, admission control, telemetry hub | Central nervous system |
| Symbiot Agent | Local OS interceptor for execution, filesystem grafting, device policy | Peripheral nerves |
| Symbiot Client | Local compositor/decoder, input injector, situation resolver | Sensorimotor cortex |
| Symbiot Protocol Stack | Secure transport for control, media, telemetry, file I/O | Circulatory system |
| Symbiot Policy Core | ACL, RBAC, conditional access, compliance enforcement | Immune system |

## 4. Behavioral Guarantees
1. **Phased-In Execution:** Any grafted path (file, directory, shortcut) triggers remote-only execution; no payload reaches the local loader.
2. **Pocket Windows:** Remote surfaces manifest as host-native windows with full OS affordances (Alt-Tab, snapping, DPI, IME, accessibility APIs). Pocket composition supports DirectComposition/DXGI interception and semantic UI streaming (WPF, Qt, Electron, WinUI, GTK, web engines).
3. **Situation Propagation:** Remote events (dialogs, child windows, credential prompts, process spawns) initiate `Situation.Push` messages. The client resolves via ACL policy, auto-action, or user consent. Child pockets spawn automatically preserving parent-child modality and z-order.
4. **Filesystem Grafting:** NTFS (reparse/minifilter) and POSIX (FUSE/VFS module) intercept open/exec I/O under mapped prefixes. Reads/writes are proxied through the Symbiot Broker to remote nodes or authoritative stores. Locking semantics and change notifications are preserved.
5. **Zero Local Execution:** Local kernel never maps remote binaries or DLLs. Only Symbiatica components run locally; all foreign code runs within remote sandboxes.
6. **Error Transparency:** Remote launch failures, crashes, dependency faults, or policy denials are surfaced via streamed dialogs, console output, or structured notifications.
7. **Multi-Window Cohesion:** All windows belonging to a remote session (including MDI/SDI child windows) are grouped, tracked, and reconstituted after reconnects.

## 5. Detailed Architecture
### 5.1 Symbiot Agent (Local Host)
- **File Graft Manager:** Maintains mapping table (local path prefix → remote mount descriptor). Provides:
  - NTFS reparse points or kernel minifilter on Windows.
  - FUSE or eBPF-based VFS hooks on Linux/macOS.
  - Per-process scoped grafts with inheritance/override to support multi-tenant workstations.
- **Execution Interceptor:** Hooks `CreateProcess`, `ShellExecute`, `NtCreateUserProcess`, POSIX `execve` families, and shell integrations. Converts intent into `Execution.Request` RPC with path, arguments, environment, working directory, token, and policy context.
- **Pocket Orchestrator:** Creates local host windows mapped to remote surfaces, manages z-order, activation, IME, accessibility bridges, and ensures accessibility events (UIA/AXAPI) reflect remote semantics.
- **Injection & Capture Shim:** For remote-bound processes launched locally (diagnostics, virtualization scenarios), provides GPU handle export (IDXGIResource shared handles, Vulkan WSI, Metal shared surfaces) and semantic instrumentation for supported toolkits.
- **Input & Device Forwarder:** Captures pointer/keyboard/IME/raw input, high-frequency device data, clipboard, drag-and-drop metadata. Enforces device ACL policies before forwarding (e.g., HID allowlists, camera/mic consent).
